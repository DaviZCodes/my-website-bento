I love my previous personal website, but I wanted to see how creative I could be. Recently, I have been fascinated by minimalistic, smart, and artistic designs, especially bento-style websites. I also love eating bento. Thus, I decided to create a new bento-style version of my website.

I also wanted to learn many things by implementing this. First of all, I wanted to improve my frontend skills, but I also wanted to be better at React. I wanted to try the useContext(), useTranslate(), and light and dark theme features. As usual, screen responsiveness was very tough, especially for smaller screens, but I was able to pull it off by restructuring the layout for smaller screens. There are still more features and pages that I want to implement, so I'll be working on that.

The picture below shows the final design sketch that I came up with. I designed it all by myself from scratch. I had many other design ideas and prototypes but I scratched those. I am very proud of this design. It was really fun bringing this to reality.
